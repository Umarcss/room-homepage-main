## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Sass/SCSS

### What I learned

Great layout practice. Also the slider was a pretty interesting experience.

### Continued development

Putting together all the different things I practiced in previous challenges is making things a lot easier currently. However, there is still so much to learn.
